Place the Bubble Brew logo file here so the site can use it as a background.

- Filename: `logo.png`
- Path: `public/logo.png`

The app expects the logo at `/logo.png` and will use it subtly in the home hero background.

If you prefer a different name, update the CSS selector in `src/App.css` (search for `background-image:url('/logo.png')`).
